###################################################################################

I-TASSER-RNA is a program for accurate de novo RNA tertiary structure prediction

######################### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ############################
System requirements: x86_64 machine, Linux kernel OS, Free disk space of more 
	than 500GB. The vast majority of the disk space will be used to store the 
	sequence databases.
######################## General information on how to run I-TASSER-RNA #################
a, RNA 3D modeling needs 
   1. RNA sequence-structure local threading meta-alignment
      algorithm for full-length initial models and spatial constraints(xx)
   2. inter-nucleotide distance prediction by a deep residual network (xx)
   3. submit RNA3D simulation jobs for first-round simulation(xx)  
   4. cluster decoys and refine cluster centroid models for second-round simulation(xx)
   5. final model selection and all-atom model construction (xx)

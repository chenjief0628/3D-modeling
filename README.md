I-TASSER-RNA is a program for accurate de novo RNA tertiary structure prediction

Note, this is the stand-alone program, users mya also submit jobs to
https//zhanggroup.org/I-TASSER-RNA
######################### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ############################

System requirements: x86_64 machine, Linux kernel OS, Free disk space of more 
	than 500GB. The vast majority of the disk space will be used to store the 
	sequence databases.
 
######################## General information on how to run I-TASSER-RNA ############
a, RNA 3D modeling needs 
   1. RNA sequence-structure local threading meta-alignment
      algorithm for full-length initial models and spatial constraints
   2. inter-nucleotide distance prediction by a deep residual network 
   3. submit RNA3D simulation jobs for first-round simulation
   4. cluster decoys and refine cluster centroid models for second-round simulation
   5. final model selection and all-atom model construction
